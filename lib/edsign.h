 * key optionally encrypted using the password ${pass}. If ${pass} is
 * not NULL, then the returned secret key is encrypted with
 * scrypt. If ${pass} is NULL, then the secret key is unencrypted.

 * The arguments ${N}, ${r} and ${p} control CPU and memory usage for
 * scrypt, and are only relevant when ${pass} is not NULL. Running
 * time of scrypt is proportional to all of ${N}, ${r} and
 * ${p}. Memory usage of scrypt is approximately 128*${r}*(2^${N})
 * bytes. For example, for N = 14, r = 8, and p = 1, memory usage is
 * 128*8*(2^14) = 16 megabytes. ${p} may be used to independently tune
 * running time.
